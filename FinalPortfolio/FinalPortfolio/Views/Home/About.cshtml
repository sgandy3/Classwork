            Hello, my name is Stephanie! I am a visual, hands-on person who enjoys creating and finding solutions.
            Technology has always held a special place <br /> in my heart so, I have decided to become a developer.
            We Can {Code} IT bootcamp has to helped me develop the necessary employable skills such <br />as C#, MVC, Object Oriented Programming,
            HTML and JavaScript.
